    ],
    "correct": "Individual differences",
    "explanation": "An inclusive classroom is characterized by a diverse group of learners with varying abilities, learning styles, paces, and backgrounds. The principle of **individual differences** is fundamental here, as it acknowledges that every child is unique and develops at their own rate. A teacher must plan a variety of activities to cater to these differences, ensuring that all students can participate and learn effectively. The other options are incorrect principles: development rates vary, development is spiral (not linear), and it proceeds from general to specific responses."

    "correct": "Both statements A and B are true and statement A offers correct explanation for statement B",
    "explanation": "Maturation is the natural, biological unfolding of an individual's potential. This biological development is a prerequisite for learning certain skills, a concept known as 'learning readiness' (Statement A). For example, a child cannot learn to write legibly before their fine motor muscles have matured. Therefore, attempting to teach a skill before a child is biologically ready (mature) is ineffective and can lead to frustration (Statement B). Statement A provides the direct reason for the outcome described in Statement B."

While Sensation is the initial step of receiving raw sensory data (e.g., light hitting the eye), **Perception** is the first cognitive step where the brain interprets and organizes this sensory information into something meaningful. This interpretation and organization of sensory input is the true starting point for forming a concept."

    "explanation": "Vertical growth in this context refers to the increase in intellectual power. Psychometric theories of **intelligence**, particularly those concerning fluid intelligence (the ability to solve novel problems), suggest that this ability peaks in late adolescence and early adulthood (around 16-20 years) and then may plateau or slowly decline. In contrast, attitudes, perception skills, and specific aptitudes can continue to develop and change throughout one's life."

    "explanation": "Self-concept is an individual's perception of their own characteristics, abilities, and qualities. The statement **'I am obedient'** is a self-assessment of a personal trait, which is a core component of self-concept. The other options describe a preference ('I like chocolates'), a temporary state ('I am feeling cold'), or a factual role ('I am in Grade VIII'), not an evaluation of one's personal character."

    "explanation": "A **questionnaire** is a self-report instrument, and its main weakness is that respondents may not answer truthfully. This can be due to social desirability bias (answering in a way that is seen as socially acceptable) or a deliberate choice to hide one's true thoughts or feelings. Projective tests, on the other hand, are specifically designed to uncover unconscious thoughts by bypassing such conscious defenses."

    "explanation": "Behaviorism is a theory of learning which states that all behaviors are acquired through conditioning. A central tenet of behaviorism is that behavior is not determined by innate factors (heredity, genes) but is a response to environmental stimuli. Behaviorists like John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner believed that the **environment** shapes and controls all behavior through processes like reinforcement and punishment."

    "explanation": "This statement perfectly summarizes the core principle of Operant Conditioning, a theory developed by **B.F. Skinner**.

    "explanation": "The process of invention often involves **trial and error**, a learning method proposed by Edward Thorndike. An inventor tries various approaches to solve a problem. The attempts that fail (errors) are discarded, and the attempts that succeed are retained and refined. This systematic process of trying different solutions until a successful one is found is a hallmark of trial-and-error learning."

His mother is now trying to get him to learn quiet behavior by observing his sister (another model). Both the acquired behavior and the desired behavior are based on learning through watching others."

Seriation is a foundational skill for understanding numbers and mathematical concepts."

This is what option 4 describes. True negative reinforcement involves removing an *unpleasant* stimulus to *increase* a desired behavior (e.g., a car stops beeping when you fasten your seatbelt).

Ramya can do simple subtraction, but subtraction with borrowing is in her ZPD. Her father provides the necessary support (the scaffold) and will gradually remove it as she becomes capable of doing it **independently**. This is a classic example of scaffolding."

Individual tests (e.g., WAIS, WISC) are administered one-on-one by a trained professional. Group tests (e.g., Raven's Progressive Matrices) can be administered to many people at once. Therefore, the classification is based on the viewpoint of administration."

It refers to the temporary support given to a learner by a More Knowledgeable Other (MKO) to help them complete a task within their Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). A critical feature of scaffolding is that the support is gradually removed as the learner's competence increases, allowing them to eventually perform the task independently."

    "explanation": "Edward Thorndike's Law of Exercise states that connections between a stimulus and a response are strengthened through practice and repetition (Law of Use). The weaver's mastery and error-free performance are a direct result of practicing the skill of weaving over many years, which has strengthened the necessary stimulus-response bonds."

The automatic, involuntary response of pulling the car to the side has become a conditioned response to the sound of the siren alone. The behavior is elicited automatically, not based on voluntary choice followed by a consequence."

It emphasizes the role of cognitive abilities, intelligence, and motivation. In contrast, imitation, the act of copying another's behavior, is a core concept in behaviorist and social learning theories (like Bandura's) and is not a principle emphasized by Gestalt theorists, who valued novel problem-solving through insight."

    "correct": "Knowledge",
    "explanation": "According to the original Bloom's Taxonomy, the 'Knowledge' level is the lowest level of cognitive skills and involves the recall of facts, terms, basic concepts, and answers. The task of simply recalling a list of places from memory fits squarely into this domain, as it requires retrieving stored information without needing to interpret or apply it."

    "explanation": "Transfer of learning refers to the effect of prior learning on new learning. Positive transfer occurs when previous learning facilitates or enhances the acquisition of new skills or knowledge. Since English and French share many grammatical structures and vocabulary due to their common roots, learning English grammar can make it easier to learn French grammar."

    "correct": "Rote memorization",
    "explanation": "Modern educational practices emphasize meaningful learning, critical thinking, and student engagement.

    "correct": "Teacher centered instruction is not systematic",
    "explanation": "This statement is incorrect. Teacher-centered instruction, such as direct instruction or lectures, is often highly structured and systematic. The teacher carefully plans the content, sequences the activities, and controls the pace of the lesson.

    "explanation": "Effective teaching focuses on fostering deep understanding and critical thinking, rather than passive reception of information or memorization for exams. Discovery learning is a student-centered, inquiry-based approach where students construct their own knowledge by exploring and problem-solving. This active engagement is a hallmark of effective pedagogy, leading to better long-term retention and application of knowledge."

    "correct": "A son of a famous musician becoming equally famous musician",
    "explanation": "Becoming a famous musician involves a combination of nature (heredity) and nurture (environment). The son might inherit a genetic predisposition for musical talent (heredity), but becoming equally famous requires an environment rich with musical exposure, training, practice, and opportunities, which a musician parent is likely to provide (environment).

The sound of the lift was initially a Neutral Stimulus. Through repeated pairing with the UCS, the sound of the lift became a Conditioned Stimulus (CS) that now triggers the excitement (Conditioned Response). Therefore, the 'Sound of the lift' (A) is the conditioned stimulus."

Initially, a child uses their whole body or both hands (a general response) to grasp an object. As motor skills develop, they gain finer control and can use just their fingers (a specific response) to manipulate the toy.

These tasks arise from physical maturation, cultural pressures, and personal aspirations."

    "explanation": "When a student's performance is below their potential (aptitude), it is a situation of underachievement. The appropriate response is guidance, which is a comprehensive process to help the student identify the root causes of the problem. These causes could be academic, personal, or emotional. Guidance aims to help the student understand themselves and their situation to make necessary improvements. While better teaching or coaching might be part of the solution, 'guidance' is the overarching process needed to diagnose the problem and find the right solution."

R-S (Response-Stimulus) conditioning refers to Operant Conditioning (Skinner), where the learner is active. The learner must first perform a voluntary action or behavior (Response), which is then followed by a consequence (Stimulus - reinforcement or punishment).

Children use private speech to plan, guide, and monitor their own behavior and thinking, especially during challenging tasks.

    "explanation": "While infants express emotions non-verbally (crying, laughing), the early childhood stage (ages 2-6) is marked by a rapid expansion of vocabulary and sentence structure. During this period, children develop the ability to use words and language to explicitly name, describe, and communicate their feelings and emotions to others."

    "explanation": "Erikson's fourth stage, Industry vs. Inferiority, occurs during the elementary school years (around ages 6-12). In this stage, children are focused on mastering academic and social tasks. Encouragement and support from teachers and peers help them develop a sense of competence and industry. Conversely, repeated failures or lack of support can lead to feelings of inferiority. Thus, it is crucial for teachers to foster a positive attitude during this stage."

'Change in behaviour' indicates that learning has a tangible outcome. 'Occurring due to experience' distinguishes learning from changes due to maturation, illness, or fatigue.

    "explanation": "This teaching method is an application of classical conditioning. The word for the object (unconditioned stimulus) naturally elicits a mental image (unconditioned response). By repeatedly pairing the picture on the flashcard (neutral stimulus) with the word, the picture eventually becomes a conditioned stimulus that elicits the mental image on its own (conditioned response). The child learns to associate the picture with the object's name and concept."

In PBL, students take an active role in their learning by investigating a complex problem or question over an extended period.

    "correct": "ensures the quality learning of the students",

This goes beyond simply transmitting information, covering the textbook, or focusing only on test scores. It involves fostering conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and a genuine love for learning."

    ],
    "correct": "both intra and inter individual differences of learners",
    "explanation": "A teacher needs to understand both types of differences for effective teaching. Inter-individual differences refer to how students differ from each other. Intra-individual differences refer to the variations in abilities and skills within a single student (e.g., strong in math but weak in reading). Recognizing both allows for better-differentiated instruction."

It should never be used as a tool to filter students out of the educational system or suggest they drop out, which goes against the principles of inclusive education."
