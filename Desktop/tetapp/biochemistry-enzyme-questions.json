    "correct_answer": "1. Increased Km, unchanged Vmax",
    "explanation": "Competitive inhibition occurs when an inhibitor competes with the substrate for the enzyme's active site. This increases the apparent Km (reduced affinity for substrate) but does not change Vmax because with sufficient substrate concentration, the inhibitor can be outcompeted. On a Lineweaver-Burk plot, competitive inhibition shows lines intersecting on the y-axis (same Vmax) with different x-intercepts (different Km).",

The inhibition cannot be overcome by increasing substrate concentration.",

Cofactor deficiency (such as thiamine, riboflavin, or other B vitamins required for metabolic enzymes) can cause this pattern.

Aspirin acetylates a serine residue (Ser530 in COX-1) in the active site, irreversibly blocking prostaglandin synthesis.
