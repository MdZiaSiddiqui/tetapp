      "Cube",
      "Cone",
      "Cylinder",
      "Sphere"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "This question confuses 'stable' and 'neutral' equilibrium. A body is in stable equilibrium if it returns to its original position after being slightly displaced. A body is in neutral equilibrium if it remains in the new position after being displaced. A sphere is always in neutral equilibrium, meaning it will rest in any position it is placed without falling over. A cube is stable only when on its face, and a cone is stable only on its base. The sphere is the best answer for a body that is in equilibrium in any orientation."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Chromoplasts are plastids that contain pigments like carotenoids, giving fruits and flowers their yellow, orange, or red colors; they are not colorless. Leucoplasts are the colorless plastids. Therefore, the pair 'Chromoplast - Colourless' is incorrect. Chlorophyll is essential for converting light energy into chemical energy during photosynthesis. Leucoplasts in young tomatoes convert to chromoplasts as the fruit ripens. Green chillies contain chloroplasts."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "To ensure cross-pollination and prevent self-pollination in a bisexual flower (which has both male and female parts), one must perform emasculation. This process involves removing the male reproductive part (androecium, or stamens) before they mature and release pollen, while leaving the female part (gynoecium) intact to receive pollen from another plant."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Alternation of generations is a life cycle pattern where an organism alternates between a multicellular diploid (sporophyte) stage and a multicellular haploid (gametophyte) stage. This is characteristic of all land plants. Selaginella, a type of fern ally, clearly exhibits this life cycle. Animals like frogs and mosquitoes undergo metamorphosis, which is a change in body form, not an alternation of haploid and diploid generations."
