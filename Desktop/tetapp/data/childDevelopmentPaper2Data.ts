    ],
    "correct": "Displacement",
    "explanation": "Displacement is an unconscious defense mechanism where the mind redirects emotions from a 'dangerous' object to a 'safe' object. Here, Shraddha is angry with her boss (the dangerous object) but cannot express it. Instead, she redirects this anger towards the papers on her table (the safe object)."

    "explanation": "While both informal play and educational play can involve imagination, cooperation, and teamwork, play used as a learning resource in a school setting is intentional. The teacher designs the activity with a specific educational goal or 'prescribed learning outcome' in mind. Informal play, by contrast, is spontaneous and driven by the child's own interests without a predetermined academic goal."

    "correct": "A teacher who reads the lesson in the classroom",
    "explanation": "Constructivism posits that learners actively build or 'construct' their own knowledge. Activities like asking probing questions, engaging in discussions, and conducting research are active processes that facilitate this construction. In contrast, a teacher simply reading a lesson positions students as passive recipients of information, offering minimal opportunity for them to engage actively and construct their own understanding."

      "identifying the abilities among students and providing the learning experiences accordingly"
    ],
    "correct": "making the students practice only mock tests daily to achieve good rank in annual examination",
    "explanation": "Effective teaching focuses on deep conceptual understanding and holistic development. Relying solely on mock tests promotes rote memorization and 'teaching to the test,' which narrows the curriculum and hinders genuine learning. The other three options—providing hands-on experiences, encouraging peer learning, and differentiating instruction—are all recognized as pedagogical best practices."

Statement (B) correctly defines positive reinforcement (adding a pleasant stimulus). Statement (C) is incorrect because negative reinforcement (removing an unpleasant stimulus) also *increases* a behavior. Statement (D) is correct because both types of reinforcement strengthen a response. Therefore, A, B, and D are correct."

    "explanation": "The boy was initially driven by extrinsic motivation – an external factor, which was the desire to avoid ridicule from friends. However, his motivation shifted to intrinsic once he started enjoying the activity for its own sake ('because of the pleasure').

    "correct": "Pre operational",
    "explanation": "Irreversibility is a key limitation of the Preoperational Stage (ages ~2 to 7). It is the child's inability to mentally reverse a sequence of events. For instance, a preoperational child may not understand that if water is poured from a short, wide glass into a tall, thin one, it can be poured back to look the same as before.

This single zygote then splits into two identical embryos early in development, which is why they share the same genetic makeup. Fraternal twins result from two ova being fertilized by two separate sperm."

This is followed by 'Private speech' (around age 3), where children talk aloud to themselves to guide their own actions. Finally, this private speech becomes internalized as 'Inner speech,' which is silent, internal thought."

At birth, an infant's head is very large in proportion to its body, making up about one-fourth of the total body length.

These tasks arise from physical maturation, cultural pressures, and personal values. Therefore, the statement that they are not linked to developmental stages is incorrect."

Key tenets include inductive reasoning (moving from specific examples to general principles) and the idea that any subject can be taught effectively in some intellectually honest form to any child at any stage of development (the concept of the spiral curriculum). Bruner argued against waiting for readiness, believing instead that instruction should be designed to foster it.

    "explanation": "Lev Vygotsky's theory posits that learning is most effective in the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). The ZPD is the range of tasks that a learner cannot yet perform independently but can accomplish with the guidance of a more knowledgeable other. 'Scaffolding' is the temporary support provided to the learner to help them master a task within their ZPD. Therefore, scaffolding is only relevant and effective for activities that fall within the ZPD."

In this scenario, Chanakya's cognitive ability (being meritorious) is linked to his social and emotional skills. The positive social feedback (appreciation from teachers) enhances his social and emotional well-being, demonstrating that development in one area impacts others."

Consequently, the central Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, did not apply to the state. (Note: This changed after the revocation of Article 370 in 2019)."

    "correct": "Dog learns to salivate on hearing bell.",
    "explanation": "This is the seminal experiment conducted by Ivan Pavlov. Classical conditioning is a learning process where a neutral stimulus (the bell) becomes associated with a meaningful, unconditioned stimulus (food) and acquires the capacity to elicit a similar response (salivation). The other options are examples of operant conditioning, where behavior is controlled by consequences (rewards/punishments)."

Operant conditioning focuses on how voluntary behaviors are strengthened or weakened by reinforcement or punishment."

    "correct": "Proficiency in one language can help in learning a second, so language skills will improve if children are encouraged to be bilingual.",
    "explanation": "This reflects the principle of linguistic interdependence. Skills, concepts, and literacy developed in a child's first language (L1) are transferable to their second language (L2). A strong foundation in the mother tongue actually supports and accelerates the learning of another language. Therefore, encouraging bilingualism is beneficial for overall cognitive and linguistic development."

    "explanation": "Abstract thought involves reasoning with concepts, principles, and generalizations that are not tied to concrete reality. According to Piaget, children in the concrete operational stage think logically but are grounded in the tangible world. They struggle with abstract ideas.

This automatic, emotional response being transferred to new stimuli is a hallmark of conditioning."
