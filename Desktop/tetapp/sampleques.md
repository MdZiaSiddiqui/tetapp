    ],
    "correct_answer": "4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease",
    "explanation": "The patient's long-term smoking history is a primary risk factor for COPD. The clinical sign of 'pursed lip breathing' is a classic finding in patients with emphysema (a component of COPD), as it helps keep the airways open during exhalation.",

    "correct_answer": "3. Polypropylene",
    "explanation": "Polypropylene (e.g., Prolene) is a non-absorbable monofilament suture. It has high tensile strength, minimal tissue reactivity, and does not degrade, which is essential for blood vessel (vascular) anastomosis where a permanent, secure closure is required.",

    "correct_answer": "1. Class IV",
    "explanation": "According to the Ellis classification of traumatic dental injuries, a Class IV fracture is defined as a traumatized tooth that has become non-vital, with or without loss of crown structure. The patient's history of trauma, discoloration (a sign of necrosis), and lack of response to vitality testing all indicate a non-vital tooth, fitting the Class IV definition.",

    "explanation": "The image provided in the document (and this alternative) shows drepanocytes (sickle-shaped red blood cells) and target cells. These are the hallmark microscopic findings of sickle cell anemia. The clinical picture of anemia (low hemoglobin) and hypoxia (due to sickling and vaso-occlusion) confirms this diagnosis.",

    "correct_answer": "2. Potato crisps, tomato, banana",
    "explanation": "The patient has severe hyperkalemia (high potassium) at 6.5 mmol/L (normal is 3.5-5.0). The question asks which foods would cause increased levels. Potatoes, tomatoes, and bananas are all well-known to be exceptionally high in potassium.",

The majority of the point (around 60-75%) is a filler, typically zinc oxide, which adds radiopacity and dimensional stability.",
